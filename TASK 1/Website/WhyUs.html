<h2> Quite simply, we are a business accelerator.</h2><br>
We take care of the tedious and time-consuming work that is associated with writing comprehensive cybersecurity documentation. By doing this, we offer a unique service to businesses - we can provide you with semi-customized IT security documentation, based on industry-recognized leading practices that include ISO, NIST, OWASP, CSA and others. This allows you to quickly obtain professionally-written IT security documentation and you have the ability to edit this documentation for your specific needs, since it comes in Microsoft Office formats. This is beyond buying an "IT security policy template" online - these products allow you to have the same level of professional quality documentation that you would expect from hiring an IT security consultant to write it for you. Please take a few minutes and look at the examples to see for yourself!<br>

Our comprehensive written information security documentation includes the policies and standards that businesses need to meet common information security requirements, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, FACTA, GLBA, as well as unique requirements like FedRAMP and NIST 800-171 compliance. We've been doing this since 2005, so we have a long track record of successfully writing IT security policies and other compliance-related documentation, such as risk assessments, vulnerability assessments and audit templates. Everything we do centers around providing your company a solid set of cybersecurity policies and standards to use as a foundation to build from!
